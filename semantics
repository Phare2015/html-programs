                    <p>
                        Cats can't taste sweetness, have a unique nose print like fingerprints, and have 18 toes
            (five on eachfront paw and four on each back paw). They have remarkable hearing, can jump up to five 
            times their height, and their whiskers help them to navigate and feel their surroundings. While nearsighted,
            they have superior peripheral and night vision. Can you imagine that the oldest cat lived to be 38 years old!

                     A resent study shows that cats' emotions are influenced by their owners. Cats can also tell
            when their owners are sad or happy. Can you belive that the intelligence of a cat is similar to that of 
            a two year old!
